## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

1. Data Layer
   Student academic records, attendance, socio-economic data stored and managed in Salesforce CRM.

2. AI Model
   Trained on historical student data to predict dropout probability using classification models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.

3. CRM Layer (Salesforce)
   Manages student interactions, counseling sessions, and intervention tracking.
   Provides real-time reports and dashboards.

4. Frontend (Optional Website/App)
   Displays predictions and counseling plans to faculty and students.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

AI and ML: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy)
CRM: Salesforce CRM (Service Cloud, Education Cloud)
Database: Salesforce Objects or External MySQL (optional)
Integration: Salesforce API, REST or GraphQL APIs
Frontend: React.js or Lightning Web Components (LWC)
